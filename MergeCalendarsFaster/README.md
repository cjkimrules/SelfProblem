## Merge Two People's Calendars to Find a Time for a Meeting.

### See details in "MergeCalendars" repository. This is more like an upgrade version.

I could've just changed the Merging method in older project to have it linear
by adding sorted arrays into one big sorted array. But I also wanted to try this way
because it makes sense to convert them into Available Slots until the very end.

Ignore the messier code. In exchange, I added some extra comments.
